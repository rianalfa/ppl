<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As previously, the main application
page, for example,  TwoByTwo.HTM, is partly an HTM file that the user
customizes to specify the shape of the data entry table, etc, and is
partly written dynamically by the program when  writeFrontEnd in
AppHelper.js is called.  Let\'s call the combined page, APP.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">APP contains either DIVs or Iframes
called Panel1-Panel5 that are made visible or invisible when one of
the tabs at the top of the page is clicked.  Clicking the tab turns
on the panel for that tab and turns off the others.  If the panel is
loaded from an HTML text string, it is a DIV.  If an HTM file is
loaded, the panel is an Iframe.  The panels contain the following:

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Panel1 &ndash; The visible part of APP,
the Start screen.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Panel2 &ndash; The data entry table,
constructed dynamically by loading Etable.htm</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Panel3 &ndash; Results, output as an
HTML string by the statistics contained in the application.js
file(e.g., TwoByTwo.HTM), formatted by the other programs in
Etable_Files.  
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Panel4 &ndash; Help as a file called
OpenEpiHelp.htm</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">DemoData &ndash; Demo, as a file
containing data saved from the Application.  This file also contains
results that are currently hidden.</P>

previous and future applications:</P>

</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">None of the Application.js
	required changing for the new application; all of the statistical
	JavaScript files are unchanged.  
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Only two Application.htm files
	required changing to correct minor incompatibilities (     and     
	).  There are no changes in the commands to generate data entry or
	output tables.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The language translation mechanism
	remains intact, although we will run update translation to catch any
	phrases that have changed.</P>

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ApplicationDemo.htm files have
	not been changed.

	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The only popup windows that appear
	are those for xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.   The entire system is heavily
	dependent on JavaScript, and some users may have to adjust their
	browsers to allow scripting.

Data Works</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the variable called DemoData
contains a file name, such as TwoByTwoDemo.htm, the file is loaded
into the DemoData iFrame when APP is loaded.  It is not displayed
because this iFrame refers to the CSS class, Panel, that keeps it
hidden.  A Demo button is included in the Start screen if the file
exists.</P>
