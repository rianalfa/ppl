<h1>Using OpenEpi</h1>
<br>
OpenEpi includes calculators as local files and also links to calculators and 
other information on the Internet.  If you have a constant Internet connection
on this machine, you may not notice the difference.  If, however, you are operating
without an Internet connection, some menu entries may return with a message that
the page cannot be found.<br><br>

The calculators are arranged so that you can choose an epidemiologic purpose, a
data description, or a particular statistical procedure.  Hence, there may be 
several ways to reach the same calculator.  If you are unsure what procedure is
appropriate, there is a menu choice under HELP that will do a Google search for
any of a large number of procedures recommended for different purposes. <br><br> 

OpenEpi is evolving, and you will see gaps, missing pages, and very spotty coverage
until things are further along.  The JavaScript statistical portal under STATISTICS
is quite mature, however, and will provide almost any kind of calculator if you are on line.
