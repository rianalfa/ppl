<h2 class=MsoNormal>OpenEpi Random Number Generator</h2>
<p class=MsoNormal>Random.htm passes though to the user in a convenient form the 
  random numbers produced by the JavaScript <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>Math.random</span></span><span class=GramE>(</span>) function.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>Hence</span> a completely 
  separate analysis of their quality is not necessary.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They <span class=GramE>are merely scaled</span> 
  to fit the range requested and placed in the required number of columns.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=MsoNormal>According to the literature on the Internet, the JavaScript 
  random number generator is adequate for many purposes, and at least one commercial 
  product built around it <span class=GramE>is offered</span> (http://www.randomizer.org/about.htm).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is, however, a “pseudorandom number generator,” 
  and not suitable for exacting applications such as cryptography.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I could not find any systematic summary of tests 
  done on the JavaScript <span class=SpellE>Math.random</span> function in various 
  browsers, which would have been important information.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>
<p class=MsoNormal>The numbers produced are allowed to repeat, that is, the numbers 
  are &quot;with replacement&quot;. It is possible that the number, 1003, may, 
  by chance, occur more than once in the numbers generated for your purpose, for 
  example. If you wish to have the effect of, say, 2000 UNIQUE numbers, you can 
  do this in at least two ways. Supposing that you are using random numbers to 
  pull hospital records for a study. If you find that one of the numbers points 
  to a chart that has already been pulled, you can simply move on to the next 
  number, essentially discarding the duplicate number. Another possibility is 
  to ask for larger numbers, for example, with six digits, where the possibility 
  of repeating is small (about 1 in a million). Of course, you could sort the 
  numbers and discard duplicates or do a frequency, but these options require 
  other software.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>Many articles are available by searching for ...<em>Random 
  Numbers Epidemiology</em>... in Google. Most do not mention quality of random 
  numbers as being important for ordinary studies, although it becomes so when 
  doing computer simulations with millions of repetitions. Here are some other 
  interesting articles on random numbers.</p>
