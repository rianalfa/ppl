<h2>Dose Response: Chi Square for Trend
</h2>
<p>The test for trend is often used for dose-response studies and can also be
  used to test for trends with age, passage of time, or any ordered variable.
  The data can be stratified on other variables like age and sex to eliminate
  confounding from these variables.</p>
<p>The Extended Mantel-Haenszel chi square that is calculated reflects the departure
  of a linear trend from horizontal (i.e., no trend). If the associated p value
  is less than .05, there is 95% probability that a trend exists in the underlying
  population.</p>
<p>For each level of &quot;exposure,&quot; an odds ratio is calculated to compare it with
  the baseline level. For level 1, for example, the odds ratio represents a two-by-two
  table with level 0 being unexposed and level 1 being the &quot;exposed&quot; group. Similar
  odds ratios are calculated to compare level 2 with level 0, level 3 with level
  0, etc. If the tables are stratified, Mantel-Haenszel summary odds ratios
  for stratified two-by-two tables are calculated rather than simple odds ratios.
  If a trend exists, the odds ratios will increase (or decrease) with increasing
  exposure.</p>
<p>In doing a stratified test for trend, both Mantel-Haenszel summary odds ratios
  and crude odds ratios are calculated for each level of exposure. If the two
  are the same or nearly the same, then confounding by the stratifying variable
  was minimal or absent, and the unstratified results can be used. The TwobyTwo
  module can be used to find confidence limits for the odds ratios if desired.</p>
<p>Levels of exposure for analysis of trend by this method must be grouped according
  to an ordered numerical sequence. The simplest groups are arbitrary ones of
  0, 1, 2, 3, etc.. These are the &quot;observations&quot; or &quot;scores.&quot; Other
  scores might be the mid-points of groups, such as 0 for 0 glasses of water,
  2 for 1-3 glasses, 4 for 3-5, etc.. These are the groups over which the presence
  of trend will be measured. Strata are determined by the confounding variables;
common strata would be age or age-sex groups.<br>
