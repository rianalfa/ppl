T["December 2012 --Version 3.0 "]="";
T["This version of OpenEpi will detect 'smartphones', such as Android phones and the iPhone, and adjust its activities to work better with small screens. In the Settings module, you can choose the screen configuration as Smartphone, Laptop, or Auto(matic) for testing purposes or if the Automatic setting fails to detect your smartphone."]=
  "";
T["In Smartphone configuration, the menu appears on a single screen and then brings up the applications as requested so that they also occupy an entire screen. Because OpenEpi uses a large amount of Javascript for calculation of the statistics, it may take a while to download all the code for a particular module. If you get tired of waiting, click the 'Menu' tab to return to the menu, and then try again."]=
  "";
T["Not all smartphones support the level of Javascript that is required for OpenEpi, and the authors do not have examples of many phones for testing purposes. Please accept that you are on your own to determine whether OpenEpi functions correctly on your brand of smartphone, and do some testing of relevent modules to see if they give the same answers obtained in OpenEpi on a laptop, Epi Info, or other statistical programs, before departing for remote statistical missions carrying only your cell phone."]=
  "";
T["The statistical code is the same for smartphones and laptops in OpenEpi, but there could be differences in rounding, formatting, and the completion of procedures that are problematic. Although all of the OpenEpi files can be downloaded as a Zip file from the Download item on the menu, it is probably best with smartphones to run OpenEpi from website, using the phone's browser. Since the phone connection is not the same as the one used by laptops, cell phones can provide Internet service in areas where wi-fi is not available."]=
  "";
T["For those interested in programming details, the use of 'frames' in HTML on the browser--once a handy way of organising the screen, has been discouraged or discontinued by major browsers. We have therefore reprogrammed OpenEpi so that each module is a separate unit not requiring a 'home' menu with frames. Most of the modules use the same source (js) files, and these are available in the browser cache after the first module has been loaded. "]=
  "";
T["The menu giving access to the programs is no longer part of a central application, but is reloaded with each module. In practical terms, this means that you can run or provide a link to a module like Proportion by finding and running its HTM file, in this case www.openepi.com/proportion.htm. It is no longer necessary to go through the EpiMenu module to run Proportion. Hence, if you would like to write an online course in statistics, using OpenEpi, you can now link to individual modules from an Internet page, a Word document, or a PowerPoint slide. Depending on your choice of screen configuration in the Settings module, the chosen statistical module will appear with or without the menu panel on the left side of the screen. In Smartphone configuration, clicking the Menu button in the upper left corner of the screen will bring up the menu."]=
  "";
T["September 2010 --Version 2.3.1 "]="";
T["This is a version only slightly updated, to be included with the distribution of Epi Info 3.5.2. A statistical error in the ANOVA module that produced slightly incorrect values for the Chi Square and p value of Bartlett's test for Equality of Variance has been corrected, so that the result now agrees closely with the one obtained in Epi Info. Small statistical problems in the SMR and ANOVA modules have been corrected. "]=
